/// FORK ADDITION — locating inline-code chips from a point, and getting their bounds back.
///
/// <para>Since <c>CodeInline</c> became a <see cref="Avalonia.Controls.Documents.Run"/> the chip is drawn
/// inside the block's own text layout, which is the right shape for rendering and leaves a host with no way to
/// make a chip INTERACTIVE: there is no control to attach a handler to, and no bounds to position an
/// affordance against. A run is not an input element.</para>
///
/// <para>Upstream solves the same problem for links by tagging the shaped run and hit-testing it
/// (<c>Link.HitTestPoint</c>); this is the equivalent for code chips, built on the span table the block already
/// computes in order to paint their backgrounds. It is offered upstream for the same reason links have it —
/// a renderer that draws something clickable-looking should let its host find out what was clicked.</para>
///
/// <para>Kept in its own file so it costs nothing to re-merge.</para>

    /// remainder of that line. Measured here: with a chip painted from x=112, HitTestPoint already returned the
    /// chip's first index at x=106. For "is the pointer on the chip" the answer has to be the thing the user can
